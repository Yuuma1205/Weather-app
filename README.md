# React + Vite

The Weather App provides real-time weather updates for any city using the OpenWeatherMap API. Users can search for a city's weather to view details like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather icons. The app features a clean, responsive design and displays city's weather on load. It's built with React and CSS, showcasing API integration in a user-friendly interface.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
